This is a simple program constisting of a client and a server. You can either add notes to the database
or you can get notes from the database and display then in the terminal. 

To start the program, you can write in terminal "python server.py" and "python client.py".
If you know another way to start both of them, feel free to do it your way, as long as they
are both running at the same time.

You are prompted with 3 different options on the client terminal:
1. Add note
2. Get notes
3. Exit.

You can execute these by typing in the corresponding number.
